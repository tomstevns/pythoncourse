    "# Exceptions\n",
    "Python uses special objects called exceptions to manage errors that arise during a program’s execution. Whenever an error occurs that makes Python unsure what to do next, it creates an exception object. If you write code that handles the exception, the program will continue running. If you do not handle the exception, the program will halt and show a traceback, which includes a report of the exception that was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are handled with `try-except` blocks. A `try-except` block asks Python to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an exception is raised. When you use `try-except` blocks, your programs will continue running even if things start to go wrong. Instead of tracebacks, which can be confusing for users to read, users will see friendly error messages that you write.\n",
